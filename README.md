MicroChallenge III


This project combines a PIR motion sensor, an LED strip, and a continuous rotation servo motor controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. The PIR sensor detects motion, triggering the LED strip to illuminate in yellow when motion is detected and purple when there is no motion. Simultaneously, the servo motor controls the movement of a 'tra$h coral', symbolizing the rebirth of discarded items. The servo motor opens and closes the 'trash flower' in response to motion, creating an interactive and visually captivating experience. This project aims to showcase the potential of repurposing and cherishing discarded materials, turning them to alive.
